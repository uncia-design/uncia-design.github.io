## Project Overview

**Tea House Design** is an intimate residential pavilion project exploring traditional tea ceremony culture integrated with contemporary residential living. The project is a small-scale, high-design residential building that demonstrates refined spatial design, sustainable materials, and cultural sensitivity. The tea house functions as both a space for traditional tea ceremony practice and a contemplative retreat within a residential compound.

**Status**: Concept Development | **Phase**: Schematic Design | **Team Lead**: Zhun Jiao, Architect

## Design Concept

The tea house embodies Japanese aesthetic principles adapted to Texas context:

**Spatial Organization**
- Entry vestibule (transition from exterior)
- Main tea room (mat room, tatami flooring, 12x15 ft)
- Preparation room (utensil storage, water preparation)
- Viewing room (observation area for ceremony)
- Small garden courtyard (roji garden)
- Minimal support spaces

**Japanese Design Principles**
- **Wabi-Sabi**: Imperfection, impermanence, incompleteness celebrated
- **Ma**: Meaningful emptiness and negative space
- **Simplicity**: Refined minimalism in form and ornament
- **Nature Integration**: Natural materials, seasonal awareness
- **Tranquility**: Acoustic separation, contemplative atmosphere
- **Craftsmanship**: Visible joinery, hand-finished materials

## Cultural & Programmatic Intent

The space supports traditional practice:

- **Tea Ceremony**: Formal space (4.5 tatami mats, ~60 sq ft) for traditional chanoyu
- **Guest Experience**: Intimate setting (4-6 guests) for meditation and ritual
- **Preparation**: Functional spaces for tea master's preparation
- **Learning**: Documentation and teaching of tea ceremony principles
- **Retreat**: Personal contemplation space beyond daily residence
- **Seasonal Awareness**: Seasonal decorations, light, plantings, apertures

## Architectural Expression

Material and structural design reflect cultural values:

- **Timber Frame**: Exposed timber structure (posts, beams, joinery) showing craftsmanship
- **Natural Materials**: Wood, plaster, paper, stone—renewable and authentic
- **Handcrafted Details**: Custom joinery, hand-plastered walls, natural finishes
- **Transparency**: Shoji screens, sliding doors allowing adaptability and layering
- **Light Control**: Filtered natural light creating contemplative atmosphere
- **Minimal Ornamentation**: Essential elements only, silence in design

## Site Integration

The tea house sits within a residential garden:

- **Garden Path (Roji)**: Stepping stone path through native plantings
- **Water Feature**: Small basin for hand-washing (tsukubai tradition)
- **Vegetation**: Japanese-inspired plantings (maples, bamboo, native understory)
- **Seasonal Succession**: Cherry blossoms (spring), maple color (fall), evergreens year-round
- **Privacy Screening**: Bamboo or plant-based barriers creating garden enclosure
- **Approach**: Purposeful path slowing pace and mental transition

## Sustainability & Materiality

Small scale emphasizes material responsibility:

- **Local Materials**: Sourced from Central Texas where possible (cedar, limestone)
- **Renewable Resources**: Sustainably harvested timber (FSC certified)
- **Traditional Building Science**: Natural ventilation, thermal mass, passive survivability
- **Minimal Systems**: Simple construction reducing environmental impact
- **Longevity**: Quality design and materials supporting 100+ year lifespan
- **Low Embodied Carbon**: Minimal mechanical systems, local sourcing

## Technical Details

- **Building Size**: 800 sq ft total (tea room 60 sq ft, support spaces 100 sq ft, garden 640 sq ft)
- **Foundation**: Traditional post-and-beam (minimal site disturbance)
- **Structure**: Timber frame with infill (plaster, wood siding)
- **Flooring**: Tatami mats (tea room), wood planks (prep, circulation)
- **Roof**: Natural slate or local stone, steep pitch for water shedding
- **Systems**: Passive survivability, no mechanical conditioning needed
- **Accessibility**: Modified universal design (steps required for tea tradition, alternative access available)
