## Project Overview

**Hutto High School** represents a transformational renovation and expansion of Hutto ISD's secondary education facility. The project modernizes aging infrastructure while adding 125,000 sq ft of new instructional, athletic, and community-serving spaces. The design prioritizes flexible learning environments, advanced STEM facilities, and wellness infrastructure aligned with 21st-century pedagogy.

**Status**: In Planning | **Phase**: Design Development | **Team Lead**: Zhun Jiao, Architect

## Design Concept

The renovation strategy maintains the core of the existing facility while completely reimagining its educational mission:

- **New STEM Wing**: Advanced laboratories for chemistry, biology, physics, engineering, and computer science with flexible configurations
- **Innovation Labs**: Maker spaces, robotics facilities, and interdisciplinary collaboration zones
- **Flexible Classrooms**: Movable partitions and modular furniture enabling diverse instructional models
- **Performance Center**: 800-seat auditorium and black-box theater for arts and community events
- **Athletic Excellence**: Regulation competition gymnasium, practice facilities, and expanded weight/conditioning rooms
- **Campus Commons**: Extended outdoor learning spaces and gathering areas supporting social-emotional learning

## Building Sustainability

The project targets **LEED Platinum** certification with comprehensive sustainability strategies:

- Energy efficiency: High-performance HVAC, LED lighting, automated controls (estimated 40% energy reduction)
- Water management: Rainwater harvesting, low-flow fixtures, on-site detention
- Materials: Low-VOC finishes, locally sourced materials, construction waste diversion (>95%)
- Resilience: Solar-ready roof design, battery backup for critical systems
- Air quality: Enhanced ventilation post-pandemic, MERV-13+ filtration

## Educational & Community Impact

- **Student Population**: 2,100 students (current) with capacity for 2,400
- **Curriculum Delivery**: Spaces designed for project-based learning, collaboration, and STEM/CTE emphasis
- **Community Use**: After-hours availability for adult education, evening events, weekend athletics
- **Equity Focus**: Accessible design throughout, technology infrastructure supporting all learners
- **Local Hiring**: Commitment to 30% local workforce on construction
