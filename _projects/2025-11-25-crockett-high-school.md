## Project Overview

**Crockett High School** represents a sustainable educational facility designed with innovative wood structure systems. The project prioritizes material transparency, natural ventilation, and daylight access—creating a learning environment that reflects environmental stewardship. The wood structure strategy demonstrates cross-laminated timber (CLT) and glulam applications in an institutional context, reducing embodied carbon while creating acoustically and thermally superior learning spaces.

**Status**: Design Phase | **Phase**: Schematic Design | **Team Lead**: Zhun Jiao, Architect

## Design Concept

The wood-first design strategy shapes the entire pedagogical experience:

- **Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) Structure**: Large-panel CLT for floors and walls, creating open, column-free learning spaces
- **Glulam Beams**: Long-span timber beams in commons areas showcasing sustainable material choice
- **Natural Ventilation**: Operable windows, thermal mass, and stack-effect design reducing mechanical cooling needs
- **Daylight Integration**: Extensive glazing, skylights, and clerestory windows minimizing artificial lighting dependency
- **Material Transparency**: Exposed timber structure celebrating renewable building systems
- **Biophilic Design**: Wood materials, natural finishes, and exterior connections supporting student wellbeing

## Sustainability Leadership

The project targets **net-zero operational carbon** with wood structure as centerpiece:

- **Embodied Carbon Reduction**: CLT/glulam reduce embodied carbon by ~60% vs. concrete/steel equivalent
- **Operational Energy**: Natural ventilation, passive cooling, and renewable energy integration
- **Water Systems**: Rainwater harvesting, greywater reuse, drought-resistant landscaping
- **Forest Stewardship**: Timber sourced from certified sustainable forests (FSC/PEFC)
- **Indoor Environmental Quality**: No-VOC finishes, thermal comfort, acoustic performance
- **Longevity**: Solid wood structure designed for 75-year lifespan with adaptability

## Educational Philosophy

- **Learning from Materials**: Students understand construction, material science, and sustainability through building itself
- **Indoor Air Quality**: No mechanical ventilation odors; natural air quality supports cognitive performance
- **Connection to Nature**: Visible wood structure and natural cycles reinforce environmental consciousness
- **Health & Wellbeing**: Daylighting, views, and natural materials demonstrating impact on occupant wellbeing
