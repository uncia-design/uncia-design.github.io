## Project Overview

**Leander High School** is one of Central Texas's most significant educational renovation projects at $200M, representing a complete transformation of the district's flagship facility. The comprehensive renovation addresses 50+ year old facilities while expanding capacity by 40% and creating spaces aligned with contemporary learning theory, workforce preparation, and community use. The project reimagines secondary education as a hub for academic, artistic, athletic, and civic engagement.

**Status**: Programming | **Phase**: Facility Needs Assessment | **Team Lead**: Zhun Jiao, Architect

## Project Scope

The renovation addresses the entire 520,000 sq ft campus with strategic new construction:

**Renovation Components**
