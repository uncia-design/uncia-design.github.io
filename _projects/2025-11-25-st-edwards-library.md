## Project Overview

**St. Edwards University Library** represents a reimagined academic library for the digital age, balancing physical book collections with contemporary collaborative learning spaces. The project respects the university's historic campus context while creating a 21st-century library that serves as the intellectual and social center of campus. The design emphasizes flexibility, technology integration, natural light, and sustainable practices—creating a welcoming space that supports learning, research, and community.

**Status**: Design Phase | **Phase**: Design Development | **Team Lead**: Zhun Jiao, Architect

## Design Concept

The library reimagines its role in contemporary higher education:

**Space Organization**
- Traditional library functions (reduced footprint): Collections, archives, circulation
- Flexible learning commons: Open studios for group work, varied seating configurations
- Technology labs: Digital media, 3D printing, coding, maker spaces
- Quiet zones: Focused study areas, private study pods
- Informal gathering: Café, lounge areas, social seating
- Adaptive reuse: Existing building shell with interior transformation

**Collections & Access**
- Curated physical collection (emphasizing rare books, special collections)
- Robust digital collections and database access
- Open stacks encouraging browsing and discovery
- Climate-controlled special collections area
- Archive and preservation facilities
- 24-hour remote access to digital resources

## Academic Mission

The facility supports St. Edwards' distinctive educational approach:

- **Research Support**: Subject librarians, research consultation areas
- **Writing Support**: Writing center integrated with collections
- **Information Literacy**: Instruction spaces and tutorial areas
- **Accessibility**: Universal design, assistive technology, inclusive practices
- **Community**: Event spaces for lectures, performances, exhibitions
- **Diversity**: Multilingual collections and programming

## Collaborative Spaces

Modern library emphasizes social and intellectual connection:

- **Learning Commons**: 40,000 sq ft flexible studio space for group work
- **Discussion Zones**: Semi-private areas for small group conversations
- **Project Studios**: Equipped spaces for class projects, research teams
- **Presentation Rehearsal**: Spaces for practice and feedback
- **Interdisciplinary Hub**: Cross-departmental collaboration areas
- **Faculty Offices**: Library-integrated faculty scholarly spaces

## Technology Integration

Advanced systems support 21st-century learning:

- **Wireless Infrastructure**: Reliable WiFi throughout, 5G ready
- **Laptop Lending**: Device checkout for students lacking personal computers
- **Digital Media Lab**: Video editing, podcast production, graphic design equipment
- **Maker Space**: 3D printers, laser cutting, electronics, woodworking tools
- **Visualization Lab**: VR/AR technology for immersive learning
- **Smart Classrooms**: Integrated AV, recording capability
- **Booking System**: Real-time space reservation and resource management

## Sustainability Features

**LEED Gold Certification** with emphasis on environmental responsibility:

- **Energy**: Solar opportunities explored, LED throughout, occupancy-based controls, geothermal systems
- **Water**: Low-flow fixtures, rainwater harvesting for landscape irrigation
- **Materials**: Sustainable procurement, reclaimed materials where possible, low-VOC finishes
- **Indoor Environmental Quality**: Daylighting (80% of spaces), natural ventilation, air quality monitoring
- **Adaptive Reuse**: Building shell preservation reduces embodied carbon vs. new construction
- **Biodiversity**: Green roof, pollinator plantings, outdoor learning spaces
