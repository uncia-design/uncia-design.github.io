## Project Overview

**Atlantis 24-Hour Living District** is a visionary master plan for a mixed-use urban district emphasizing vibrant 24-hour activation, transit orientation, and diverse housing. The 25-acre district envisions 1,200 residential units (mix of market-rate and affordable), 200,000 sq ft of retail/dining/entertainment, offices, hotels, and extensive public spaces. The design prioritizes walkability, cultural vitality, sustainability, and community over automobiles—creating a live-work-play destination.
