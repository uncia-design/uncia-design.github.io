## Project Overview

**Bastrop High School** renovation and addition project addresses aging infrastructure in a historic community while preparing students for future workforce and higher education demands. The project strategically renovates the existing 1970s facility core while adding modern STEM facilities, enhanced athletic spaces, and flexible learning environments. The design respects Bastrop's heritage while creating a forward-looking educational facility.

**Status**: Schematic Design | **Phase**: Value Engineering | **Team Lead**: Zhun Jiao, Architect

## Design Strategy

The project balances renovation of the existing structure with targeted new construction:

**Renovation Work**
- Structural assessment and selective reinforcement
- MEP systems complete replacement (plumbing, electrical, HVAC, controls)
- Interior finishes including classrooms, corridors, restrooms
- Administrative areas and student support services
- Roof replacement with solar-ready membranes

**New Construction**
- STEM-focused academic building (50,000 sq ft)
- Expanded athletics complex (25,000 sq ft gymnasium, training facilities)
- Outdoor learning commons and amphitheater
- Enhanced parking and drop-off circulation

## Educational Programming

Spaces designed for contemporary teaching methods:

- Science and engineering laboratories with hands-on focus
- Flexible classroom furniture and technology infrastructure
- Collaborative learning commons and project spaces
- CTE pathways (construction trades, healthcare, business)
- Art studios and performance spaces
- Community education evening access

## Community Context

Bastrop's historic and cultural significance shapes design approach:

- Respectful massing that complements neighborhood context
- Outdoor gathering spaces supporting community events
- Public art integration opportunities
- Environmental education aligned with local ecology (post-wildfire recovery)
- Local hiring and workforce development emphasis

## Sustainability Features

**LEED Silver Certification** with community climate action alignment:

- Energy efficiency: High-performance HVAC, LED lighting, occupancy controls
- Water: Rainwater harvesting, drought-resistant landscape, water-efficient fixtures
- Materials: Local sourcing where possible, low-VOC finishes
- Resilience: Solar potential infrastructure, backup systems
- Environmental education: Visible sustainability systems (teaching tools)
