## Project Overview

**Leander Early College High School** represents a new paradigm in secondary education—a purpose-built campus enabling dual enrollment, early college credit completion, and workforce preparation. The design integrates academic rigor with career readiness, featuring flexible learning environments, university partnership facilities, and maker/innovation spaces. Students can graduate with high school diploma plus associate degree or industry certification, positioned for immediate post-secondary success.

**Status**: Construction | **Phase**: 60% Built | **Team Lead**: Zhun Jiao, Architect

## Educational Model

The physical environment supports an innovative curricular approach:

- **University Partnership Spaces**: Dedicated areas for college faculty, dual-enrollment courses, and credit-bearing instruction
- **STEM & CTE Integration**: Advanced laboratories for engineering, health sciences, information technology
- **Maker Spaces**: Digital fabrication (3D printing, laser cutting), electronics, product design
- **Flexible Classroom Configurations**: Movable furniture and technology enabling varied instructional models
- **Student Support Services**: Enhanced counseling, career services, and mentorship spaces
- **Community Integration**: After-hours access for adult learners and workforce development

## Campus Design Strategy

The 180-acre campus creates a distinct "college feel" while maintaining high school accessibility:

- **Academic Core**: Three-building cluster of classrooms and laboratories with shared commons
- **University Center**: Partnership building with college instruction, faculty offices, student collaboration
- **Arts & Innovation Hub**: Dedicated spaces for visual arts, performing arts, and design/innovation
- **Athletics & Wellness**: Multi-purpose gymnasium, outdoor fields, fitness center
- **Student Life**: Dining, commons, study areas supporting extended campus days
- **Parking & Circulation**: Designed for both high school (drop-off) and college-age (independent) access

## Sustainability Integration

**LEED Gold Certification** with focus on healthy learning environments:

- Energy-efficient systems with solar-ready infrastructure (50% solar potential)
- Daylighting and natural ventilation in 85% of spaces
- Water conservation: Rainwater harvesting, on-site retention, native landscaping
- Indoor air quality: Advanced filtration, low-VOC materials, operable windows
