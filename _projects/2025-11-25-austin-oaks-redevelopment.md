## Project Overview

**Austin Oaks Redevelopment** represents a comprehensive master plan for a 17-acre office campus in central Austin, creating a mixed-use district that reimagines the suburban office park as a vibrant, human-scaled community. The plan envisions 850,000 sq ft of office space, retail, dining, wellness facilities, and outdoor gathering spaces designed around walkability, sustainability, and quality of life. The project demonstrates how corporate campuses can serve as civic anchors supporting local economy and culture.

**Status**: Master Planning | **Phase**: Design Framework | **Team Lead**: Zhun Jiao, Architect

## Master Plan Strategy

The campus design organizes development around key principles:

**Campus Organization**
- Central plaza and gathering commons (5 acres public/semi-public space)
- Three primary office buildings (180K-220K sf each) arranged around central axis
- Retail and dining district along primary street frontage
- Wellness center and recreation facilities
- Employee housing component (optional, mixed-income)
- Dedicated parking structures (1,200+ spaces) with ground-level activation

**Circulation & Connectivity**
- Pedestrian-priority network with shaded walkways and seating
- Bike infrastructure (300+ bike parking, protected lanes)
- Shuttle service connecting transit hubs and parking
- Emergency vehicle access with minimal impact on pedestrian zones
- Future light rail station preparation

**Outdoor Spaces**
- Central plaza: Events, farmers markets, seasonal programming
- Meditation gardens: Quiet contemplation spaces
- Amphitheater: 1,500-person performance capacity
- Sports courts: Basketball, pickle ball, futsal
- Native plantings: Habitat restoration and stormwater management

## Office Building Design

Three contemporary office buildings optimize flexibility and wellness:

- **Modern architectural language**: Sustainable design, biophilic elements
- **Flexible floor plans**: Open, modular, adaptable to diverse tenants
- **Outdoor connections**: Terraces, gardens, green roofs
- **Wellness integration**: Fitness, nutrition, mental health spaces
- **Technology infrastructure**: 5G ready, smart building systems

- Building B: 200,000 sf (corporate headquarters/anchor tenant)
- Building C: 180,000 sf (tech/creative office)
- Parking Structures: 1,200 spaces (tiered, with EV charging)
