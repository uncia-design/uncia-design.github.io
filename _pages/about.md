## About Uncia

**Uncia** is the architecture and design studio of **Zhun Jiao** (Architect) and **Annie Jiao** (Data Engineer). We're a husband-wife team based in Austin, Texas, specializing in institutional design, residential development, and data-driven project delivery.

### The Name

The name *Uncia* carries multiple meanings that resonate with our practice:

- **Latin Origin**: Uncia means "a twelfth"—the root of the English word "inch"—representing precision and measurement in design
- **Pronunciation**: In Mandarin Chinese, uncia (云家) sounds similar to "yún jiā," meaning "my house"—reflecting our commitment to creating meaningful spaces
- **Natural History**: Uncia was the former genus of the snow leopard (*Panthera uncia*), symbolizing rare beauty, adaptation, and resilience in challenging environments
