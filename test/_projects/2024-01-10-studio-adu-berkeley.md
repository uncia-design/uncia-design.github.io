## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how thoughtful ADU design can transform a backyard into a productive asset. The clients had a large lot and wanted to increase property income while maintaining privacy. We designed a beautiful 400 sq ft studio with a loft sleeping area.

## Design Excellence

The design balances several competing priorities:
- **Rental Appeal** - Modern, well-lit, attractive to quality tenants
- **Efficient Use of Space** - Every square foot earns its place
- **Code Compliance** - Zero permit issues or rework
- **Sustainability** - Long-term low operating costs

## Financial Success

The ADU rents for $2,400/month, generating $27,360 annually at 95% occupancy. Combined with the property value increase, the project returns over 31% ROI in year one. The clients will recoup their investment in approximately 6.25 years, after which all rental income is profit.

## Lessons Learned

This project taught us that successful ADU design requires equal attention to three things:
1. Code requirements (non-negotiable)
2. Rental market preferences (return determines success)
3. Homeowner preferences (privacy, aesthetics, integration)

By balancing all three, we created an ADU that works financially, legally, and harmoniously within the existing property.
